I was born in the State of _Kuwait_ on **16 August 2000**.
\ I was born and raised in the country for the next *seventeen years*.\ Throughout my life, I realized my love for: \n - Finance \n - Arts \n - Music \n - Literature \n After high-school, I went in to study in my home country: *India*. I did my undergraduate in **Christ University, Bengaluru.**\ Three years later, I applied to the MFA programme at LBS and got admitted to the batch of 2022.
