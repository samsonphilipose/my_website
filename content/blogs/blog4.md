I was born in the State of _Kuwait_ on **16 August 2000**. This is the flag of the country: ![Image of the Kuwait flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Flag_of_Kuwait.svg/383px-Flag_of_Kuwait.svg.png). I was born and raised in the country for the next *seventeen years*.\ Throughout my life, I realized my love for: - Finance - Arts - Music - Literature \. After high-school, I went in to study in my home country: *India*. I did my undergraduate in **Christ University, Bengaluru.**\ Three years later, I applied to the MFA programme at LBS and got admitted to the batch of 2022.
